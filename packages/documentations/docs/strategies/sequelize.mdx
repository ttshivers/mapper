## Overview

`@ttshivers/automapper-sequelize` is an official strategy that works with [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/). `@ttshivers/automapper-sequelize` is an extension of `@ttshivers/automapper-classes`

## Installation

```shell
npm i @ttshivers/automapper-core @ttshivers/automapper-classes @ttshivers/automapper-sequelize
```

```shell
yarn add @ttshivers/automapper-core @ttshivers/automapper-classes @ttshivers/automapper-sequelize
```

## Usage

Using `@ttshivers/automapper-sequelize` isn't different from using [`@ttshivers/automapper-classes`](./classes#usage). The difference is `@ttshivers/automapper-sequelize` has a custom `preMap` that handles how to serialize the `sourceObject` because of how Sequelize returns the object upon a Retrieve operation and a custom `destinationConstructor`.

### `preMap`

Use `Sequelize#Model.get()` if it's available to serialize the `sourceObject`

### `destinationConstructor`

Use `Sequelize#Model.build()` if it's available to construct the `destinationObject`.

We can customize this `preMap` via `MappingStrategyInitializerOptions`

```ts
const mapper = createMapper({
    strategyInitializer: sequelize({
        preMap: customPreMap,
        destinationConstructor: customDestinationConstructor,
    }),
});
```
