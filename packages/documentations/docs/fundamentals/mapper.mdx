## Mapper

`Mapper` is the main character in AutoMapper TypeScript. Everything starts with a `Mapper`. To create a `Mapper`, call `createMapper()` along with a [Strategy](#mappingstrategy)

```ts
const mapper = createMapper({
    strategyInitializer: classes(),
});
```

## MappingStrategy

In order for `Mapper` to map properties, `Mapper` needs to know about the properties' metadata. That's what the Strategy provides to the `Mapper`. A Strategy deals with:

-   Discover the metadata: Based on the user input, a strategy needs to know how to discover the metadata of the models from that input. E.g: `@ttshivers/automapper-classes` can discover the metadata with `@AutoMap` decorator.
-   Retrieve the metadata: A strategy has its own "storage" to store the raw metadata. In order for `Mapper` to work consistently, a Strategy needs to provide a way to retrieve this metadata in the shape that `Mapper` can understand. E.g: `@ttshivers/automapper-classes` stores the metadata in `Reflect` object.
-   Apply the metadata: By default, `Mapper` knows how to apply the metadata for a specific model. However, the consumers can customize this behavior by passing in a custom `applyMetadata` function.

In addition to dealing with metadata, a Strategy also provides two hooks:

-   `preMap`: Runs before the map operation starts. This step is usually to prepare the `sourceObject` before it goes into the `map` operation.
-   `postMap`: Runs after the map operation starts. This step is usually to massage the result `destinationObject` before it gets returned to the user.

### Official Strategies

AutoMapper TypeScript comes with 4 official strategies:

| package                           | strategy      | description                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@ttshivers/automapper-classes`   | `classes()`   | Works with TS/ES6 Classes                                         |
| `@ttshivers/automapper-pojos`     | `pojos()`     | Works with Interfaces/Types                                       |
| `@ttshivers/automapper-mikro`     | `mikro()`     | Works with TS/ES6 Classes and [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/)   |
| `@ttshivers/automapper-sequelize` | `sequelize()` | Works with TS/ES6 Classes and [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) |

:::info

`mikro()` and `sequelize()` are extensions of `classes()`. They call `classes()` with different `MappingStrategyInitializerOptions`

## Logger

AutoMapper TypeScript exposes a logger via the symbol `AutoMapperLogger`. There are 4 log levels:

-   `log`
-   `warn`
-   `info`
-   `error`

By default, these log levels are implemented using the `console`'s counterparts in addition to having `[AutoMapper]` as the prefix.

```ts
console.log('some log'); // some log
AutoMapperLogger.log('some log'); // [AutoMapper]: some log
```

### Customization

We can customize `AutoMapperLogger` via `AutoMapperLogger.configure()`

```ts
// in your application's entry point, at the top
AutoMapperLogger.configure({
    warn: null, // nullify "warn" completely
});
```

There is one caveat in terms of customizing `AutoMapperLogger` which is **having to** call `AutoMapperLogger.configure()` **as soon as possible** so we need to pick a file that is guaranteed to run **early**, preferably earlier than **decorators**.

-   In NestJS, this can be `app.module.ts`
-   In Angular, this can be `polyfills.ts`

The caveat stems from the fact that `@AutoMap` decorator from `@ttshivers/automapper-classes` does have a `AutoMapperLogger.warn` call when it fails to infer the type from Reflection. This might not be a desired behavior in certain environments.
