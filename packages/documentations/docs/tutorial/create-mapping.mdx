Our models have been prepped from the last step. It is time to create the `Mapping` between them.

:::tip

Mappings creation are fast and should be placed where the application starts so that they are only created **once**.

:::

## `createMap()`

```ts title="/src/main.ts"
import { createMap } from '@ttshivers/automapper-core';
import { mapper } from './mappings/mapper';
import { Bio, BioDto } from './models/bio';
import { User, UserDto } from './models/user';

createMap(mapper, Bio, BioDto);
createMap(mapper, User, UserDto);
```

:::tip

Order of `createMap()` matters. Since `Bio` and `BioDto` are nested models on `User` and `UserDto`, the `Mapping<Bio, BioDto>` needs to be created first in order for `Mapping<User, UserDto>` to be initialized correctly.

:::

`createMap(mapper, Source, Destination)` will create and return a `Mapping<Source, Destination>`. Let's test the Mappings out with the following `User`

```ts
const user = new User();
user.firstName = 'Chau';
user.lastName = 'Tran';
user.username = 'ctran';
user.password = '123456';
user.bio = new Bio();
user.bio.avatarUrl = 'google.com';
user.bio.birthday = new Date();
user.bio.job = new Job();
user.bio.job.title = 'Developer';
user.bio.job.salary = 99999;
```

## `map()`

To execute a map operation from `User` to `UserDto`, you invoke:

```ts
const dto = mapper.map(user, User, UserDto);
```

You will notice that the call runs successfully but with two errors logged to the console.

```
[AutoMapper]
Unmapped properties for Bio -> BioDto:
-------------------
jobTitle,
jobSalary

[AutoMapper]
Unmapped properties for User -> UserDto:
-------------------
fullName
```

Let's also take a look at the `dto`

```
UserDto {
    bio: BioDto {
        avatarUrl: 'google.com',
        birthday: 2022-03-23T22:46:17.110Z
    },
    username: 'ctran',
    lastName: 'Tran',
    firstName: 'Chau'
}
```

It is clear that `bio.jobTitle`, `bio.jobSalary`, and `fullName` are missing. The errors are correct. Additionally, there's also another "error": `UserDto#birthday` is a `string` but it holds a `Date` value now because it was mapped from `User#birthday`.

Let's fix the issues one by one in the next section.
