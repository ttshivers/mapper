## Overview

`@ttshivers/automapper-classes` is an official strategy that works with ES6/TS Class-based projects. It is recommended to use with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) backend as NestJS works very well with Classes.

## Installation

```shell
npm i @ttshivers/automapper-core @ttshivers/automapper-classes
```

```shell
yarn add @ttshivers/automapper-core @ttshivers/automapper-classes
```

## Usage

We have been using `@ttshivers/automapper-classes` throughout the documentation. Check [Tutorial](../tutorial/preface) for more information about usage.

## Metadata

### `AutoMap`

`AutoMap` is a `PropertyDecorator` to track a property's metadata on a class. `@AutoMap()` has 3 overloads:

-   `@AutoMap()`: Use on primitives like `string`, `number`, and `boolean`. `Date` is also acceptable.
-   `@AutoMap(() => Type | [Type])`: Supply a `Type` so `AutoMap` does not have to guess (or cannot guess). Use on nested models, enums, array types, complex union types, or ambiguous types (e.g: `any`, `Record`)

-   `@AutoMap(AutoMapOptions)`: Take complete control of the data that `AutoMap` stores

#### Enum

In TypeScript, there are 2 main types of Enums that we can have: String and Numeric. In order for AutoMapper to work correctly with Enums, we need to supply the type of our enums with `AutoMap()`

```ts
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

enum Role {
    Admin = 'admin',
    User = 'user',
}

class User {
    @AutoMap(() => String) // string enum
    role!: Role;
    @AutoMap(() => Number) // numeric enum
    color!: Color;
}
```

#### Array type

As mentioned above, we need to explicitly supply a type to `AutoMap` if the property has an Array type

```ts
class User {
    @AutoMap(() => [Date])
    logins!: Date[];
}
```

#### Circular Dependency

It is common to have circular dependency in terms of models when we work with an ORM. By default, AutoMapper sets a `depth` value of `1` for nested models.

In other words, let's assume we have a circular dependency: `A <-> B`

```ts
class A {
    b: B;
}

class B {
    a: A;
}

// depth 1
A {
    b: B {
        a: A {
            b: undefined
        }
    }
}

// depth 2
A {
    b: B {
        a: A {
            b: B {
                a: undefined
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We can configure the `depth` by using the `AutoMapOptions` with `AutoMap`
